package ch.bsisa.hyperbird.model

/**
 * Functions helping to read and write model objects 
 * to and from miscellaneous serialisation formats, 
 * for instance JSON and XML.
 * 
 * These functions heavily depend on third party libraries such as: 
 - Play Framework `play.api.libs.json` 
 - Lift Framework `net.liftweb.json`
 * 
 * which must not be the case for model objects. 
 * 
 * It might be useful to package model objects and utilities to read 
 * and write them from miscellaneous serialisation formats separately 
 * depending on usage and technologies evolutions.
